# Theory about this code:

# This code demonstrates Decision Tree Classification using a student dataset.
# The dataset is loaded with Pandas, and Age and English are used as input features to predict the Result.
# The data is divided into training and testing sets, and a Decision Tree model is trained on the training data.
# The model predicts results for the test data and is evaluated using Accuracy and a Classification Report.
# Finally, Matplotlib visualizes the trained Decision Tree, showing how the model makes classification decisions.
